## üîó Phase 2: MCP Integration (Week 2)

**Goal**: Connect to external MCP tools via stdin/stdout using existing TypeScript SDK  
**Deliverable**: External MCP tools work with namespaced execution via stdio transport

### üìö **Context: Understanding MCP Integration**

**Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open standard that enables LLM applications to connect to external data sources and tools in a standardized way. MCP servers act as bridges that give LLMs controlled access to:

- **Resources**: Data sources (files, databases, APIs) - similar to GET endpoints
- **Tools**: Action capabilities (file operations, API calls) - similar to POST endpoints  
- **Prompts**: Reusable interaction templates for LLMs

**Why MCP Integration is Critical for QCode:**
- **Extensibility**: Connect to external MCP servers (GitHub, Slack, databases, etc.)
- **Ecosystem**: Leverage existing MCP server implementations 
- **Interoperability**: Standard protocol ensures compatibility with future tools
- **Security**: Controlled, namespaced access to external capabilities

**Phase 2 Architecture Overview:**
```
QCode CLI ‚Üí QCode Engine ‚Üí Tool Registry ‚Üí MCP Client (stdio only) ‚Üí External MCP Server
