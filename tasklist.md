  - [ ] **1.8.5.2 Sequential Tool Execution Chains**:

    - [ ] **1.8.5.2.1 Enhanced LLM Context Management**:
      
      **Current Context Management Issues:**
      
      The current `processWithLLMFunctionCalling` method (lines 481-820) uses a simple array to build conversation history (lines 565-575) without intelligent truncation. Results are formatted through `formatToolResult()` (lines 1052-1115) which outputs full content regardless of size, causing conversation context to explode exponentially in multi-step workflows.

      **Current Flow Analysis:**
      - Conversation history is built as simple message array in `conversationHistory` (lines 565-575)
      - Tool results are added via `stepResults.push(formattedResult)` (line 697) with no size consideration
      - Full result text is joined and pushed to conversation with `stepResults.join('\n')` (line 731)
      - Large file contents (>2KB) flood LLM context without summarization
      - Context window fills rapidly, degrading LLM performance in complex workflows

      **Files to modify:**
      - `src/core/engine.ts` - Replace conversation building (lines 565-575) and result formatting (lines 1052-1115)
      - `src/types.ts` - Add new interfaces for intelligent context management

      **Architecture Strategy:**
      
      **Phase 1: Structured Tool Results**
      Create intelligent result objects that separate display content from LLM context. Current `formatToolResult()` method creates user-friendly strings but loses semantic structure needed for smart context management.

      **Phase 2: Context-Aware Conversation Building**
      Replace the simple array appending in `conversationHistory.push()` (line 734) with intelligent memory management that preserves key findings while discarding verbose content.

      **Phase 3: Multi-Step Context Preservation**
      Enhance `shouldContinueWorkflow()` method (lines 825-880) to make decisions based on structured context rather than string matching on conversation content.

      **New interfaces needed in `src/types.ts`:**
      ```typescript
      // Structured tool result for intelligent context management
      export interface StructuredToolResult {
        // Tool execution metadata
        toolName: string;
        success: boolean;
        duration: number;
        
        // Result categorization for smart formatting
        type: 'file_content' | 'file_list' | 'search_results' | 'analysis' | 'error';
        
        // Human-readable summary for conversation context (max 500 chars)
        summary: string;
        
        // Key extracted information for workflow decisions
        keyFindings: string[];
        
        // Full raw data for detailed analysis when needed
        fullData: any;
        
        // Size management flags
        truncated: boolean;
        originalSize?: number;
        
        // Context for next workflow step
        contextForNextStep: Record<string, any>;
        
        // File-specific extracted metadata
        filePaths?: string[];
        patterns?: string[];
        errors?: string[];
      }

      // Enhanced conversation memory management
      export interface ConversationMemory {
        // Original user intent
        originalQuery: string;
        
        // Current workflow position
        stepNumber: number;
        maxSteps: number;
        
        // Structured results from previous steps
        previousResults: StructuredToolResult[];
        
        // Extracted patterns and decisions
        extractedPatterns: Record<string, any>;
        
        // Working memory for cross-step context
        workingMemory: Record<string, any>;
        
        // Conversation size management
        totalContextSize: number;
        maxContextSize: number;
      }

      // Context-aware message formatting
      export interface ContextMessage {
        role: 'system' | 'user' | 'assistant';
        content: string;
        metadata?: {
          toolResults?: StructuredToolResult[];
          stepNumber?: number;
          contextSize?: number;
          truncated?: boolean;
        };
      }
      ```

      **Implementation Strategy:**

      **1. Replace formatToolResult() Method (lines 1052-1115)**
      
      Current method creates monolithic strings. Replace with:
      ```typescript
      private createStructuredResult(
        toolName: string, 
        result: ToolResult, 
        stepContext: ConversationMemory
      ): StructuredToolResult {
        // Analyze result type and extract key information
        // Create intelligent summaries based on content size
        // Extract actionable data for next steps
      }
      
      private formatResultForConversation(
        structuredResult: StructuredToolResult,
        stepContext: ConversationMemory
      ): string {
        // Size-aware formatting for LLM context
        // Preserve important information while discarding verbose content
        // Adapt formatting based on step position in workflow
      }
      ```

      **2. Enhance Conversation Building (lines 731-734)**
      
      Replace simple string concatenation with intelligent memory management:
      ```typescript
      private buildContextAwareConversation(
        conversationMemory: ConversationMemory,
        newResults: StructuredToolResult[]
      ): ContextMessage[] {
        // Sliding window context management
        // Key findings extraction and preservation
        // Size-based truncation with semantic awareness
      }
      ```

      **3. Upgrade shouldContinueWorkflow() (lines 825-880)**
      
      Current method uses string matching on conversation content. Replace with structured decision making:
      ```typescript
      private shouldContinueWorkflow(
        memory: ConversationMemory,
        hadErrors: boolean,
        iterationCount: number
      ): boolean {
        // Analyze structured results instead of string content
        // Make decisions based on extracted patterns
        // Consider workflow completeness vs. context size
      }
      ```

      **Specific Implementation Areas:**

      **File Result Summarization:**
      - Large file contents (>2KB): Extract file type, key functions/classes, structure

      WORKFLOW STRATEGIES:
      For complex queries, break them into logical steps:

      1. PROJECT UNDERSTANDING:
         - Always start with project structure analysis
         - Look for package.json, tsconfig.json, README files
         - Identify framework and architecture patterns
         
      2. SEQUENTIAL EXECUTION:
         - List relevant files first, then read specific ones
         - Search for patterns before analyzing code
         - Read configuration files to understand project setup
         
      3. ANALYSIS CHAINING:
         - Use results from previous steps to inform next actions
         - Maintain context about project type and structure
         - Focus on files most relevant to the user's query

      CONTEXT MANAGEMENT:
      - Summarize large outputs for conversation context
      - Extract key findings and pass them forward
      - Track file relationships and dependencies
      
      EXECUTION PATTERNS:
      - "Analyze project" = list ‚Üí identify patterns ‚Üí read key files ‚Üí summarize
      - "Find issues" = search patterns ‚Üí read matches ‚Üí analyze context
      - "Review changes" = list recent files ‚Üí read changes ‚Üí assess impact`;
      ```

      **Tasks:**
      - [ ] Design context-aware prompting strategies
      - [ ] Add workflow pattern detection keywords
      - [ ] Implement step-by-step reasoning guidance
      - [ ] Add context preservation instructions

    - [ ] **1.8.5.2.4 Tool Result Formatting for LLM Context**:

      **Files to modify:**
      - `src/core/engine.ts` - Replace `formatToolResult()` method (lines 1052-1069)
      - `src/tools/files.ts` - Enhance result objects with metadata

      **Current issues to fix:**
      - Results over 2KB flood conversation context
      - File lists with 50+ files overwhelm LLM
      - Search results lose important context in formatting
      
      **Enhanced formatting strategy:**
      ```typescript
      private formatToolResultForLLMContext(
        toolName: string, 
        result: ToolResult,
        stepContext: ChainContext
      ): string {
        // Different formatting based on step position and result size
        if (stepContext.stepNumber === 1 && result.data?.files?.length > 10) {
          return this.formatProjectOverview(result);
        }
        
        if (result.data?.content?.length > 2000) {
          return this.formatContentSummary(result);
        }
        
        return this.formatFullResult(result);
      }
      ```

      **Tasks:**
      - [ ] Implement structured summaries for large file lists (>20 items)
      - [ ] Extract key findings from search results automatically
      - [ ] Context-aware result truncation based on query intent

        private maxSteps = 10;
        
        compressHistory(history: ConversationMessage[]): ConversationMessage[] {
          // Keep system prompt + user query + last 3 assistant messages
          // Summarize older steps to preserve key findings
        }
        
        extractKeyContext(result: ToolResult): KeyContext {
          // Extract file paths, patterns, errors for future reference
          // Discard verbose content while preserving actionable information

   - **File Editing**: `"Change the h1 in App.js to h2"` ‚Üí CRA fixture
   - **Project Understanding**: `"Find all React components and list their props"` ‚Üí CRA fixture
   - **Complex Workflows**: `"Find TODO comments, read files, suggest fixes"` ‚Üí All fixtures

4. **Broke Down Section 1.8.5** - Expanded the minimal 1.8.5 into comprehensive workflow orchestration:
   - **1.8.5.1**: Workflow State Management (context tracking, error recovery)
   - **1.8.5.2**: Sequential Tool Execution Chains (multi-step workflows)
   - **1.8.5.3**: Complex Query Understanding (intent detection, decomposition)
   - **1.8.5.4**: VCR Tests for Complex Workflows (comprehensive test coverage)
   - **1.8.5.5**: Performance & Reliability (optimization, error handling)

### üéØ **Next Immediate Priorities for Phase 1 Completion:**

1. **Create Project Fixtures** (1.7 completion):

   - Build the realistic test projects (CRA, Express API, Monorepo)
   - Essential for validating agent capabilities with real-world scenarios

2. **Implement 1.8.5 Workflow Orchestration**:

   - Start with 1.8.5.1 (Workflow State Management)
   - Build foundation for multi-step agent intelligence
   - This is the core of our agent's reasoning capabilities

3. **Agent Validation Tests**:
   - Test scenarios like `"Change h1 to h2 in React app"`
   - Validate end-to-end file editing capabilities
   - Ensure agent can understand and execute complex project modifications

### üöÄ **Strategic Focus:**

The updated tasklist now prioritizes **agent intelligence and real-world capability validation** over comprehensive edge-case testing. We can now build and test complex workflows that demonstrate QCode's ability to understand projects and make intelligent modifications.
