## üìã **STRATEGIC TASKLIST UPDATES - PHASE 1 FOCUS**

### ‚úÖ **Key Changes Made:**

1. **Removed Non-Essential Tests** - Streamlined testing by removing edge cases like "write to read-only directory" and "concurrent write conflict handling" that aren't critical for MVP

2. **Added Comprehensive Project Fixtures** - Replaced generic test fixtures with realistic project structures:
   - `react-cra/`: Complete Create React App for testing file editing scenarios  
   - `ts-express-api/`: TypeScript Express API for backend testing
   - `monorepo-workspace/`: Multi-package workspace for complex scenarios

3. **Created Agent Validation Test Scenarios** - Added specific, testable scenarios:
   - **File Editing**: `"Change the h1 in App.js to h2"` ‚Üí CRA fixture
   - **Project Understanding**: `"Find all React components and list their props"` ‚Üí CRA fixture  
   - **Complex Workflows**: `"Find TODO comments, read files, suggest fixes"` ‚Üí All fixtures

4. **Broke Down Section 1.8.5** - Expanded the minimal 1.8.5 into comprehensive workflow orchestration:
   - **1.8.5.1**: Workflow State Management (context tracking, error recovery)
   - **1.8.5.2**: Sequential Tool Execution Chains (multi-step workflows)
   - **1.8.5.3**: Complex Query Understanding (intent detection, decomposition)
   - **1.8.5.4**: VCR Tests for Complex Workflows (comprehensive test coverage)
   - **1.8.5.5**: Performance & Reliability (optimization, error handling)

### üéØ **Next Immediate Priorities for Phase 1 Completion:**

1. **Create Project Fixtures** (1.7 completion):
   - Build the realistic test projects (CRA, Express API, Monorepo)
   - Essential for validating agent capabilities with real-world scenarios

2. **Implement 1.8.5 Workflow Orchestration**:
   - Start with 1.8.5.1 (Workflow State Management) 
   - Build foundation for multi-step agent intelligence
   - This is the core of our agent's reasoning capabilities

3. **Agent Validation Tests**:
   - Test scenarios like `"Change h1 to h2 in React app"`
   - Validate end-to-end file editing capabilities
   - Ensure agent can understand and execute complex project modifications

### üöÄ **Strategic Focus:**
The updated tasklist now prioritizes **agent intelligence and real-world capability validation** over comprehensive edge-case testing. We can now build and test complex workflows that demonstrate QCode's ability to understand projects and make intelligent modifications.
