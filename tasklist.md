# QCode Implementation Task List

## üìã Overview

This task list implements the QCode TypeScript-based AI coding assistant as outlined in the implementation plan. The project is organized into 4 weekly phases with clear deliverables.

**Target**: Enterprise-grade QCode with zero API costs, full privacy control, and Claude Coder-level user experience.

## üß† **STRATEGIC INSIGHT: LLM-Centric Agent Intelligence**

**üéØ MAJOR ARCHITECTURAL PIVOT COMPLETED**: The project has shifted from a rule-based pattern-matching approach to a fully LLM-centric orchestration system where the LLM itself makes all decisions about tool usage and workflow execution.

### **üîÑ The LLM-Centric Transformation**

**Previous Rule-Based Approach (DEPRECATED):**

```bash
qcode "add user authentication"
# ‚Üí Rule engine matches patterns and executes predefined workflows
# ‚Üí Limited to hardcoded scenarios and patterns
# ‚Üí Brittle and unable to adapt to new contexts
```

**New LLM-Centric Approach (IMPLEMENTED):**

```bash
qcode "add user authentication"
# ‚Üí LLM analyzes query with full project context
# ‚Üí LLM decides which tools to call and in what order
# ‚Üí LLM adapts response based on actual project structure
# ‚Üí LLM provides contextual, project-aware solutions
```

### **üéØ Core LLM-Centric Principles Now Implemented**

1. **LLM Orchestration First** - LLM makes all tool execution decisions, not hardcoded rules
2. **Context-Driven Intelligence** - LLM analyzes actual project data before generating responses
3. **Adaptive Tool Chaining** - LLM determines when and how to chain multiple tool calls
4. **Project-Aware Responses** - LLM generates answers that fit the specific codebase context
5. **Self-Directing Agent** - LLM manages its own workflow without predetermined patterns

### **üèóÔ∏è The New LLM-Centric Architecture (Revised Priority Order)**

1. **üß† LLM Orchestration Engine** - ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - LLM makes all decisions about tool usage
2. **üìù Project Intelligence Tool** - ‚úÖ **PARTIALLY COMPLETE** - LLM-powered project analysis
3. **üìÅ File Operations Tool** - ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - LLM-directed file system operations
4. **üîß Additional Tools** - Shell, Git, Code editing as LLM-orchestrated capabilities
5. **üí¨ Interactive Chat** - Persistent LLM conversations with project memory

**Bottom Line**: The LLM is now the central intelligence that coordinates all operations, making QCode a true AI agent rather than a sophisticated rule-based script executor.

## üîó Phase 2: MCP Integration (Week 2)

**Goal**: Connect to external MCP tools via stdin/stdout using existing TypeScript SDK  
**Deliverable**: External MCP tools work with namespaced execution via stdio transport

### üìö **Context: Understanding MCP Integration**

**Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open standard that enables LLM applications to connect to external data sources and tools in a standardized way. MCP servers act as bridges that give LLMs controlled access to:

- **Resources**: Data sources (files, databases, APIs) - similar to GET endpoints
- **Tools**: Action capabilities (file operations, API calls) - similar to POST endpoints
- **Prompts**: Reusable interaction templates for LLMs

**Why MCP Integration is Critical for QCode:**

- **Extensibility**: Connect to external MCP servers (GitHub, Slack, databases, etc.)
- **Ecosystem**: Leverage existing MCP server implementations
- **Interoperability**: Standard protocol ensures compatibility with future tools
- **Security**: Controlled, namespaced access to external capabilities

**Phase 2 Architecture Overview:**

```
QCode CLI ‚Üí LLM Engine ‚Üí Tool Registry ‚Üí MCP Client (stdio only) ‚Üí External MCP Server

### 5.2 Edit Tool Backup System Design

**Goal**: Design and implement a proper backup system for the File Editing Tool that doesn't pollute workspaces while providing safety and rollback capabilities for users working with version-controlled codebases.

#### 5.2.1 Backup Strategy Research

- [ ] Research industry best practices for code editing tool backups
- [ ] Analyze how existing tools (VS Code, IDEs) handle file versioning
- [ ] Determine optimal balance between safety and workspace cleanliness
- [ ] Study user workflows and expectations around file recovery

#### 5.2.2 Global Backup Architecture

- [ ] Design `~/.qcode/backups/` directory structure
- [ ] Implement workspace identification and organization
- [ ] Create timestamp-based versioning system
- [ ] Design efficient storage and cleanup policies

#### 5.2.3 Integration with Version Control

- [ ] Detect Git/version control presence in workspaces
- [ ] Disable or minimize backups in version-controlled projects
- [ ] Provide user configuration options for backup behavior
- [ ] Create backup system that complements rather than duplicates VCS

#### 5.2.4 Smart Backup Triggers

- [ ] Implement selective backup (only for significant changes)
- [ ] Create configurable backup frequency settings
- [ ] Design rollback interface for easy recovery
- [ ] Add backup cleanup and retention policies

#### 5.2.5 User Experience Design

- [ ] Create clear configuration options for backup preferences
- [ ] Design intuitive rollback commands and interfaces
- [ ] Implement backup status and history visibility
- [ ] Add documentation for backup system usage

**Design Considerations**:

- **Clean Workspaces**: Zero pollution of user project directories
- **VCS Integration**: Smart detection and deference to existing version control
- **User Choice**: Configurable backup behavior based on user preferences
- **Performance**: Efficient storage and minimal overhead
- **Recovery**: Easy rollback and restoration capabilities

**Research Questions**:

- Should backups be disabled by default in Git repositories?
- What's the optimal cleanup/retention policy for backup files?
- How should backup configuration be exposed to users?
- What's the right balance between safety and workspace cleanliness?
