# QCode Implementation Task List

## üìã Overview

This task list implements the QCode TypeScript-based AI coding assistant as outlined in the implementation plan. The project is organized into 4 weekly phases with clear deliverables.

**Target**: Enterprise-grade QCode with zero API costs, full privacy control, and Claude Coder-level user experience.

## üß† **STRATEGIC INSIGHT: LLM-Centric Agent Intelligence**

**üéØ MAJOR ARCHITECTURAL PIVOT COMPLETED**: The project has shifted from a rule-based pattern-matching approach to a fully LLM-centric orchestration system where the LLM itself makes all decisions about tool usage and workflow execution.

### **üîÑ The LLM-Centric Transformation**

**Previous Rule-Based Approach (DEPRECATED):**

```bash
qcode "add user authentication"
# ‚Üí Rule engine matches patterns and executes predefined workflows
# ‚Üí Limited to hardcoded scenarios and patterns
# ‚Üí Brittle and unable to adapt to new contexts
```

**New LLM-Centric Approach (IMPLEMENTED):**

```bash
qcode "add user authentication"
# ‚Üí LLM analyzes query with full project context
# ‚Üí LLM decides which tools to call and in what order
# ‚Üí LLM adapts response based on actual project structure
# ‚Üí LLM provides contextual, project-aware solutions
```

### **üéØ Core LLM-Centric Principles Now Implemented**

1. **LLM Orchestration First** - LLM makes all tool execution decisions, not hardcoded rules
2. **Context-Driven Intelligence** - LLM analyzes actual project data before generating responses
3. **Adaptive Tool Chaining** - LLM determines when and how to chain multiple tool calls
4. **Project-Aware Responses** - LLM generates answers that fit the specific codebase context
5. **Self-Directing Agent** - LLM manages its own workflow without predetermined patterns

### **üèóÔ∏è The New LLM-Centric Architecture (Revised Priority Order)**

1. **üß† LLM Orchestration Engine** - ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - LLM makes all decisions about tool usage
2. **üìù Project Intelligence Tool** - ‚úÖ **PARTIALLY COMPLETE** - LLM-powered project analysis
3. **üìÅ File Operations Tool** - ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - LLM-directed file system operations
4. **üîß Additional Tools** - Shell, Git, Code editing as LLM-orchestrated capabilities
5. **üí¨ Interactive Chat** - Persistent LLM conversations with project memory

**Bottom Line**: The LLM is now the central intelligence that coordinates all operations, making QCode a true AI agent rather than a sophisticated rule-based script executor.

### 1.7.19 Project-Specific Shell Intelligence

**Concrete Intelligence Examples**:

- **Script Detection & Execution**:

  ```javascript
  // User: "Run the development server"
  // LLM first calls: internal.files (reads package.json)
  // Detects: { "scripts": { "dev": "next dev", "start": "node server.js" } }
  // LLM calls: internal.shell
  {
    "command": "npm",
    "args": ["run", "dev"], // Chooses "dev" over "start" for development
    "stream_output": true
  }
  ```

- **Test Framework Detection**:

  ```javascript
  // User: "Run the tests"
  // LLM first calls: internal.project (analyzes test setup)
  // Detects: Jest config + test files in __tests__/
  // LLM calls: internal.shell
  {
    "command": "npm",
    "args": ["test", "--", "--watch"], // Adds watch mode for development
    "stream_output": true
  }
  ```

- **Build Tool Intelligence**:

  ```javascript
  // User: "Build the project"
  // LLM first calls: internal.files (checks for build configs)
  // Detects: Makefile present + package.json build script
  // LLM calls: internal.shell (prefers Makefile for native projects)
  {
    "command": "make",
    "args": ["build"],
    "working_directory": "."
  }
  ```

- **Package Manager Detection**:
  ```javascript
  // User: "Install the dependencies"
  // LLM first calls: internal.files (checks lock files)
  // Detects: yarn.lock present (not package-lock.json)
  // LLM calls: internal.shell
  {
    "command": "yarn", // Uses yarn instead of npm
    "args": ["install"],
    "stream_output": true
  }
  ```

**Concrete Use Cases**:

- **User says**: "Start the dev server" ‚Üí **LLM detects**: Next.js project ‚Üí **Calls**: `npm run dev`
- **User says**: "Run tests in watch mode" ‚Üí **LLM detects**: Jest config ‚Üí **Calls**: `npm test -- --watch`

## üîó Phase 2: MCP Integration (Week 2)

**Goal**: Connect to external MCP tools via stdin/stdout using existing TypeScript SDK  
**Deliverable**: External MCP tools work with namespaced execution via stdio transport

### üìö **Context: Understanding MCP Integration**

**Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open standard that enables LLM applications to connect to external data sources and tools in a standardized way. MCP servers act as bridges that give LLMs controlled access to:

- **Resources**: Data sources (files, databases, APIs) - similar to GET endpoints
- **Tools**: Action capabilities (file operations, API calls) - similar to POST endpoints
- **Prompts**: Reusable interaction templates for LLMs

**Why MCP Integration is Critical for QCode:**

- **Extensibility**: Connect to external MCP servers (GitHub, Slack, databases, etc.)
- **Ecosystem**: Leverage existing MCP server implementations
- **Interoperability**: Standard protocol ensures compatibility with future tools
- **Security**: Controlled, namespaced access to external capabilities

**Phase 2 Architecture Overview:**

```
QCode CLI ‚Üí LLM Engine ‚Üí Tool Registry ‚Üí MCP Client (stdio only) ‚Üí External MCP Server
                                     ‚Üí Internal Tools (files, project)
```

**Phase 2 Design Principle**: **Use existing @modelcontextprotocol/sdk** - no reinventing the wheel!

### 2.1 MCP SDK Integration Foundation

  - [ ] Keep minimal - leverage SDK types where possible
- [ ] Testing Requirements:
  - [ ] SDK integration and wrapper functionality tests
  - [ ] Configuration and error handling tests

### 2.2 Stdio Client Implementation

  - [ ] Process management using SDK's built-in capabilities
  - [ ] Connection lifecycle management via SDK
  - [ ] No custom JSON-RPC implementation - use SDK entirely

### 2.3 Process Configuration

- [ ] Server command/args configuration from QCode config
- [ ] Environment variable passing to servers
- [ ] Working directory configuration
- [ ] Process resource monitoring (basic)

### 2.4 Error Handling

- [ ] SDK error handling integration
- [ ] Process crash detection and recovery

**Note**: HTTP/SSE transport moved to Phase 4 - focusing on stdio foundation first

### 2.6 Server Configuration System

- [ ] Extend `src/config/` with MCP server definitions:
  - [ ] `MCPServerConfig` interface for stdio servers
  - [ ] Configuration validation with Zod schemas
  - [ ] Server discovery from config files
  - [ ] Simple stdio-only configuration - no HTTP complexity

### 2.7 Configuration Sources

  - [ ] Server status monitoring (connected/disconnected/error)
  - [ ] Basic health checking via SDK ping
  - [ ] Server lifecycle management
  - [ ] Keep simple - advanced features in later phases

### 2.9 Registry Extension for MCP

  - [ ] Tool execution routing to appropriate MCP clients
  - [ ] Dynamic tool loading when servers connect
  - [ ] Server failure graceful degradation

### 2.10 Namespace Management

- [ ] Simple collision detection and resolution
- [ ] Tool listing by namespace
- [ ] No complex aliasing - keep simple for Phase 2

### 2.11 MCP Tool Execution

- [ ] Route tool calls to appropriate MCP client
- [ ] Parameter validation before SDK call
- [ ] Result transformation for QCode engine
- [ ] Error handling and user-friendly messages

### 2.12 Integration with Existing Engine

- [ ] Seamless integration with LLM orchestration engine
- [ ] LLM can call both internal and MCP tools transparently
- [ ] Consistent result formatting with `ContextManager`
- [ ] Reuse existing LLM orchestration from Phase 1

### 2.13 MCP Configuration (Simplified)

Stdio Server Configuration Schema:

```json
