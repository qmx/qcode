# QCode Implementation Task List

## üìã Overview

This task list implements the QCode TypeScript-based AI coding assistant as outlined in the implementation plan. The project is organized into 4 weekly phases with clear deliverables.

**Target**: Enterprise-grade QCode with zero API costs, full privacy control, and Claude Coder-level user experience.

## üß† **STRATEGIC INSIGHT: LLM-Centric Agent Intelligence**

**üéØ MAJOR ARCHITECTURAL PIVOT COMPLETED**: The project has shifted from a rule-based pattern-matching approach to a fully LLM-centric orchestration system where the LLM itself makes all decisions about tool usage and workflow execution.

### **üîÑ The LLM-Centric Transformation**

**Previous Rule-Based Approach (DEPRECATED):**

```bash
qcode "add user authentication"
# ‚Üí Rule engine matches patterns and executes predefined workflows
# ‚Üí Limited to hardcoded scenarios and patterns
# ‚Üí Brittle and unable to adapt to new contexts
```

**New LLM-Centric Approach (IMPLEMENTED):**

```bash
qcode "add user authentication"
# ‚Üí LLM analyzes query with full project context
# ‚Üí LLM decides which tools to call and in what order
# ‚Üí LLM adapts response based on actual project structure
# ‚Üí LLM provides contextual, project-aware solutions
```

### **üéØ Core LLM-Centric Principles Now Implemented**

1. **LLM Orchestration First** - LLM makes all tool execution decisions, not hardcoded rules
2. **Context-Driven Intelligence** - LLM analyzes actual project data before generating responses
3. **Adaptive Tool Chaining** - LLM determines when and how to chain multiple tool calls
4. **Project-Aware Responses** - LLM generates answers that fit the specific codebase context
5. **Self-Directing Agent** - LLM manages its own workflow without predetermined patterns

### **üèóÔ∏è The New LLM-Centric Architecture (Revised Priority Order)**

1. **üß† LLM Orchestration Engine** - ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - LLM makes all decisions about tool usage
2. **üìù Project Intelligence Tool** - ‚úÖ **PARTIALLY COMPLETE** - LLM-powered project analysis
3. **üìÅ File Operations Tool** - ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - LLM-directed file system operations
4. **üîß Additional Tools** - Shell, Git, Code editing as LLM-orchestrated capabilities
5. **üí¨ Interactive Chat** - Persistent LLM conversations with project memory

**Bottom Line**: The LLM is now the central intelligence that coordinates all operations, making QCode a true AI agent rather than a sophisticated rule-based script executor.

## üîó Phase 2: MCP Integration (Week 2)

**Goal**: Connect to external MCP tools via stdin/stdout using existing TypeScript SDK  
**Deliverable**: External MCP tools work with namespaced execution via stdio transport

### üìö **Context: Understanding MCP Integration**

**Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open standard that enables LLM applications to connect to external data sources and tools in a standardized way. MCP servers act as bridges that give LLMs controlled access to:

- **Resources**: Data sources (files, databases, APIs) - similar to GET endpoints
- **Tools**: Action capabilities (file operations, API calls) - similar to POST endpoints
- **Prompts**: Reusable interaction templates for LLMs

**Why MCP Integration is Critical for QCode:**

- **Extensibility**: Connect to external MCP servers (GitHub, Slack, databases, etc.)
- **Ecosystem**: Leverage existing MCP server implementations
- **Interoperability**: Standard protocol ensures compatibility with future tools
- **Security**: Controlled, namespaced access to external capabilities

**Phase 2 Architecture Overview:**

```
QCode CLI ‚Üí LLM Engine ‚Üí Tool Registry ‚Üí MCP Client (stdio only) ‚Üí External MCP Server
                                     ‚Üí Internal Tools (files, project)
```

**Phase 2 Design Principle**: **Use existing @modelcontextprotocol/sdk** - no reinventing the wheel!

### 2.1 MCP SDK Integration Foundation

- Limited to predefined scenarios
- Brittle and inflexible
- Pattern matching for intent detection

**After (LLM-Centric)**:

- LLM makes all orchestration decisions
- Adapts to any scenario intelligently
- Self-directing and context-aware
- Natural language understanding throughout

### üéØ **Next Immediate Priorities:**

1. **Complete Phase 1 Supporting Tools**:

### üåü **Current Real-World Capabilities:**

```bash
# LLM-powered project analysis
qcode "analyze this project and tell me about its architecture"
# ‚Üí Comprehensive, intelligent project analysis across any language/framework

# Context-aware file operations
qcode "show me the main configuration files for this project"
# ‚Üí LLM discovers and displays relevant config files based on project type

# Intelligent technology detection
qcode "what testing framework is this project using and how is it configured?"
# ‚Üí LLM analyzes actual project structure and provides accurate, contextual answers
```

**Status**: Phase 1 delivers a **true AI coding agent** with LLM intelligence at its core, representing a significant advancement over traditional rule-based approaches.
