# Commit Workflow Rules

## NEVER commit without explicit user instruction

**Absolute Rules:**
- ❌ **DO NOT** run `git commit` unless the user explicitly says "commit" or "commit this"
- ❌ **DO NOT** add and commit in one command without permission
- ❌ **DO NOT** assume the user wants changes committed

**Always validate before any commit:**
1. `npm run validate` (includes TypeScript check, linting, formatting, tests)
2. Review what files are being committed with `git status`
3. Only commit when explicitly instructed

**Proper workflow:**
```bash
# After making changes:
npm run validate  # Always run this first
git status        # Show what changed
# Wait for explicit commit instruction from user
```

**Exception:** Only commit immediately if the user says:
- "commit this"
- "commit these changes" 
- "please commit"
- Or other explicit commit instructions

**The user wants control over commits - respect this.**
